# Temperature stabilization using inter-process communication
The server takes in 4 connectiions and their initial temperatures. Then, it calculates the new central temp from the formula below, sending that value back to the external processes. The external processes then calculate their own temperature to then be sent back to the central process. Once all external temps have stabilized, connections are closed and final values are printed.
**External processes:**

$$
\text{externalTemp} \longleftarrow \left(3 \cdot \text{externalTemp} + 2\cdot \text{centralTemp} \right) / 5
$$

**Central process:**

$$
\text{centralTemp} \longleftarrow \left(2 \cdot \text{centralTemp} + \sum_{i=1}^4 \text{externalTemp}_i \right) / 6
$$




# Directions

#### Compilation instructions

```shell
gcc utils.c tcp_server.c -o server
gcc -o client tcp_client.c utils.c
```

#### Here is a typical command line, run each in its own terminal

Open a terminal and run: 

```shell
./server
```

Open four terminals and in each one run: 

```shell
./client <external index> <initial temperature>
```

##### Example:      

```shell
./client 1 100
```

```shell
./client 2 200
```

```shell
./client 3 300
```

```shell
./client 4 400
```
